Security System with sonar.

This is a project that incorprates the use of an ultrasonic sensor to measure the distance between the sensor and the object.
Furthermore, the sensor is mounted on a servo motor so that the sensor can rotate 180 degrees and use the angle of rotation to obtain the
x and y coordinates of the detected object so that I could map it on the TFT 3.5" screen.

The system is set effective if and only if motion has been detected by the PIR motion sensor in a range of 6-8 meters and stays effective
for a period of 5 minutes.
